Below are the task details:

Description:  The main goal of the task is to implement the application, performing the convolution operation on the input data.
The conversion of the image is not expected to be done in scope of this task, so the input is 3 dimensional matrix.


Theoretical material÷â


High level explanation of convolution operation can be found in following links:

Inputs:

Inputs - the input is the matrix of size [1 x 32 x 32].
It must be possible to provide more that one input matrix.
The input (s) must be read from file. 
Filter the matrix of size [1 x 5 x 5].
it must be possible to change the filter and apply different filters on the same input matrix.
it must be possible to implement multiple filters on the same input data.
the filter (s) must be specified in the file, read by application .
Biases - single bias value is used for each filter. 

Output:
the result of the operation is a matrix of the dimension: [1 x 28 x 28]
The output must be dumped into the result file

Functional Verification:

Appropriate test must be created to verify that the operation works properly.

Language Requirements:

Preferable implementation is in C++
python implementation is also acceptable as an alternative, if it is not a C++.

Documentation Requirements:

Overview of the solution must be explained in the document.
provide the details on what is convolutions, what filters are used in the implementation, other implementation details.

Reporting requirements:
weekly report to Alina/Naira expecting weekly report by the progress.
Questions can be clarified via e-mail communication.

Duration:
    2weeks (10 man days) are required to complete the implementation above.
